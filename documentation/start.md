This faucet is made to be easily configurable, letting non developers easily fork the project and run their faucet within a hour. On the other hand, experienced developers should be able to easily make tweaks, extend the faucet, and implement their own features.

Most likely, the only files you need to edit are the `.env` and `config.json` files. !(link to the docs respecitvely here)!
